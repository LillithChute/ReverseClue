# Reverse Clue

Congratulations on deciding to be a super cool gamer and electing to find out what it feels like to be on the other side of 
the game of Clue.  Instead of trying to figure out who the killer is, you get to BE the killer!  On 
your journey to committing homicide, remember to have fun and be creative!

This help menu will guide you on your journey to understanding the game elements and the controls you 
will need to destroy the target of your choice.  If you don't feel a sense of relief at the conclusion 
of absolutely annihilating your opponent, you have done it wrong.

# Game Board Basic Layout.

![Game Board](../helpmenu/PlayingArea.png "Game Board")

The game board consists of several areas.  There is the menu bar which has: 
1. File - For loading a new world, replaying with the same world, exiting the game.
2. Game - Game operations related to adding players and starting the game.
3. Help - That's how you got here, silly!

At the center of the board is where the World map will be displayed containing all the various 
rooms, players, and the target of your wrath.

To the left of the map, are three buttons related to actions the players can take on their turn.

To the right of the map are two panels.  The top panel displays the weaponry that is located in the 
room of the current player.  Below that is a panel that displays the implements of destruction that 
the current player is carrying around.

The area below the map contains a field that displays all the actions that have taken place during 
the course of playing the game.  Think of it as a diabolical diary of your plan of death!

# Menu Items

So, you are wondering what these little bad boy menu items are for and how they can help me kill my 
least favorite target?  Well, here we go..

1. **New Game With Another World** - This lets you select from wherever you are storing your world building files, any world to play than the one you are playing.  You *could* also pick the one that you just played, but that would be a little weird, don't you think?
2. **New Game With Same World** - THis just restarts the game using the same world map you just played.  You get to kill that enemy of yours all over again!  Huzzah!
3. **Exit** - Duh.

This menu is key to getting your ultimate revenge plot off the ground.  You must start here.  Before you can 
work out your frustrations, you need to add players to the game.  So, add yourself!  Add your friends!  Have a party!!!!

1. **Add human player** - If you are a human and will be the one taking control of the death and destruction, you want to use this menu item.
2. **Add CPU Player** - If you want a challenge, you can add a computer player to play against.  The computer will automatically take actions and try to kill the target before you do.
3. **Start Game** - Once you have added all the players, hit the start button, and you are on your way!

Finally, we have the **Help**.  If you are reading this, you have already been there and know what you are doing.  Also, 
click on the **About..** to find out who the **brilliant minds** are behind this incredible game! 

# Adding Players

When you are ready to play, the first thing you want to do is add players to the game.  Go to the **Game** menu item and select either 
Add Human or Add CPU.  YOu will be presented with the following menu:

![Add Player](../helpmenu/AddPlayer.png "Add Player")

When you decide to add either a computer or human player, you are presented with the same dialog box.  THere 
are three pieces of information you need to provide to create a player.  You need a name, obviously.  Second, you need 
to pick a starting location on the map.  THe list are all the possible locations where you can begin.  Throw a dart!  Finally, 
the last piece of information is the maximum number of dangerous weapons that you can carry.  For a challenge, choose a small number.  You can also go 
really big so you can scarf up everything on the map! Who says you can't carry 324,567 weapons? 

Once you have finished adding players, click on **Start Game** within the *Game* menu to begin.
