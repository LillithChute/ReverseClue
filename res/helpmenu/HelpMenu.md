The game board consists of several areas.  There is the menu bar which has: 
1. File - For loading a new world, replaying with the same world, exiting the game.
2. Game - Game operations related to adding players and starting the game.
3. Help - That's how you got here, silly!

At the center of the board is where the World map will be displayed containing all the various 
rooms, players, and the target of your wrath.

To the left of the map, are three buttons related to actions the players can take on their turn.

To the right of the map are two panels.  The top panel displays the weaponry that is located in the 
room of the current player.  Below that is a panel that displays the implements of destruction that 
the current player is carrying around.

The area below the map contains a field that displays all the actions that have taken place during 
the course of playing the game.  Think of it as a diabolical diary of your plan of death!
